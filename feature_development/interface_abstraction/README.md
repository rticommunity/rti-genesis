# Interface Abstraction Initiative

Goal: decouple UIs from DDS by centralizing graph construction in the Genesis library behind a `GraphService`, using NetworkX for the in-process model and Cytoscape.js for web visualization.

- Plan: see `plan.md`
- Prototypes: see `prototypes/`
- Tests: see `tests/`
