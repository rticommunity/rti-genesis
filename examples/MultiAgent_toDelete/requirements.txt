# Genesis Multi-Agent Smart Assistant Ecosystem
# Requirements file for the example implementation

# Core Genesis Library (assumed to be installed separately)
# The Genesis library should be installed before running this example

# OpenAI API for AI agents
openai>=1.0.0

# Additional Python standard library modules used:
# - asyncio (built-in)
# - logging (built-in) 
# - uuid (built-in)
# - time (built-in)
# - datetime (built-in)
# - typing (built-in)
# - dataclasses (built-in)
# - enum (built-in)
# - signal (built-in)
# - sys (built-in)
# - os (built-in)

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality:
# If you want weather services, set OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY environment variable
# No additional packages needed for weather - uses standard urllib

# Development/testing dependencies (optional):
# None required - all tests use standard library modules

# Note: This example is designed to be lightweight and relies primarily on
# the Genesis library and Python standard library modules.
