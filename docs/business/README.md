# Business Docs

This directory groups non-technical documentation such as SBIR reports, proposals, and demo/presentation materials.

- sbir/: SBIR-related reports, alignment notes, and milestone tables
- demos/: Demo and presentation plans, SOW diagrams, and interactive presentation artifacts
- proposals/: Proposals and high-level overview reports

If technical docs reference these files by relative paths, update links accordingly.
