## 1. Programmatic Information
See ReportTemplate.md Section 1 for full boilerplate; unchanged.

## 2. Phase II Effort (Sprint 7 Focus)
- Milestone M7 objective: “Agent Service Registry – Design, Implementation & Demo.”
- We transitioned from a brokered registry to a fully distributed design on DDS. Functions are advertised via `FunctionCapability` and discovered by agents network‑wide; invocation is performed by RPC to the advertised `service_name`.
- This distributed approach eliminated SPOFs, enabled real-time composition, and underpins the agent‑as‑tool model.

## 3. Phase II Work Plan Alignment (M7)
- Delivered a working distributed registry and demo with agents and services joining/leaving dynamically. Discovery, targeting, and invocation validated in examples.
- Monitoring integrated: agents publish agent→service edges upon discovery; services publish service→function edges on advertisement. Graph viewer displays full topology.

### 3.1 Delta from Plan (M7)
- Original acceptance: “DAF acceptance of registry functionality” via a demo and technical documentation.
- Delivered (delta): Implemented a fully distributed registry (DDS advertisements + RPC) instead of a broker. This exceeds the original design goals by removing SPOFs and enabling real-time composition. A working demo and extensive docs are included (see Appendices).
- Rationale: Distributed registry was a prerequisite for reliable security and scale; brokered approach would have throttled dynamic composition and mixed trust domains.

## 4. Task Status Updates (Task 7)
- Implemented capability advertisement/discovery and standardized function metadata (name, description, JSON schema, provider_id, service_name).
- Enhanced service base class to auto‑register functions and publish capabilities on startup; added durable re‑publish for late joiners.
- Agent side: cached discovered functions and routed calls via `FunctionRequest/Reply` to the correct service endpoint.
- Integrated with OpenAIGenesisAgent: unified toolset now includes discovered functions; LLM’s tool selections trigger the correct DDS RPC calls.

## 5. Quantitative Metrics (Service Registry)

## 6. Architecture Summary (Distributed Registry)
- Advertisement: Services publish `FunctionCapability` with `function_id`, `name`, `description`, JSON `parameter_schema`, `provider_id`, and `service_name`.
- Discovery: Agents listen and maintain a discovery cache. Late joiners recover from durable QoS.
- Invocation: Agents send `FunctionRequest` (JSON args) and receive `FunctionReply` (JSON result) via DDS RPC to the published `service_name`.
- Monitoring: GraphMonitor publishes service→function edges; agents publish agent→service edges as functions are discovered.

## 7. Risks, Issues, and Mitigations
- Service/Function churn in large deployments: mitigated by durable discovery and re‑publish; graph-based monitoring aids diagnosis.
- Schema drift between services and agents: mitigated with strict JSON schema validation at service boundary and @genesis_tool schemas for internal tools.

## 8. Next Steps (Security Staged)
- DDS Security profiles for request/reply topics and capability advertisements.
- Authorship verification for capability ads and requester identity mapping.
- Access control per environment/partition; threat model and tests (replay, spoofing, malformed ads).
